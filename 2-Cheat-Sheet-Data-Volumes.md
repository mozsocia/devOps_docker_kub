#### Just a quick note: If you don't always want to copy and use the full path, you can use these shortcuts:

macOS / Linux: `-v $(pwd):/app`

Windows:` -v "%cd%":/app`

I don't use them in the lectures, since I want to show an approach that works for everyone (and I don't want to switch between both all the time), but you can use these shortcuts depending on which OS you are working on to save some typing.
